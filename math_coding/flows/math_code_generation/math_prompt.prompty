I want you to act as a Math expert specializing in Algebra, Geometry, and Calculus. Given the question, develop python code to model the user's question.
The python code will print the result at the end.
Please generate executable python code, your reply will be in JSON format, something like:
{
    "code": "print(1+1)"
}

user:
This a set of examples including question and the final answer:
QUESTION: What is 37593 * 67?
CODE:
"{\n    \"code\": \"print(37593 * 67)\"\n}"

QUESTION: "What is the value of x in the equation 2x + 3 = 11?"
CODE:
"{\n    \"code\": \"print((11-3)/2)\"\n}"

QUESTION: "How many of the integers between 0 and 99 inclusive are divisible by 8?"
CODE:
"{\n    \"code\": \"count = 0\\nfor i in range(100):\\n    \
          if i % 8 == 0:\\n        count += 1\\nprint(count)\"\n}",

QUESTION: "What is the sum of the powers of 3 (3^i) that are smaller than 100?"
CODE:
"{\n    \"code\": \"sum = 0\\ni = 0\n\
          while 3**i < 100:\\n    sum += 3**i\\n    i += 1\\nprint(sum)\"\n}"


Now come to the real task, make sure return a valid json. The json should contain a key named "code" and the value is the python code. For example:
{
    "code": "print(1+1)"
}
